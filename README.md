Hello! My name is Duncan Payne, and I'm a software developer, designer and multi-media artist based out of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. After graduating from the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma in 2020 with a degree in Sculpture and Expanded Media, I spent a few years as a freelance artist while working various part time jobs. After talking to several family members and friends in software development, I decided to make the switch, so I took three different bootcamps offered by NuCamp over the course of 2022. Since then I've been networking, honing my skills, and applying for jobs.

As a developer I am passionate about making websites and applications that fit the needs of the client. Through my work, I seek to engage users and foster curiosity in technology. At the moment, I'm working on building a new portfolio site for myself to display my projects.
